For the day-to-day side of things, the built-in code style, functionality, and structure tests are helpful in maintaining the current standards when adding new code. The built-in code generators are also a significant help, speeding up the overall pace of development. Spryker's technical support reps are also competent and responsive. The customizability and flexibility of the Spryker system (as well as the wealth of additional add-ons) meant that it was easy to pair Spryker with our current systems.\" ",
