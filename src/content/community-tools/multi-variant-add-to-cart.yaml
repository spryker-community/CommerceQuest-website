title: Multi Variant Add-to-Cart
subtitle: ""
description: >
  This module adds a Twig widget that allows customers to select quantities for multiple product variants and add them to the cart in a single action. 
  It streamlines the shopping experience for products with variants by enabling bulk add-to-cart functionality, 
  customizable display of variant attributes, and seamless integration with Spryker's cart system.
