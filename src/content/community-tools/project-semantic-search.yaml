title: Spryker Project Semantic Search Tool
subtitle: ""
description: >
  This tool enables intelligent, 
  context-aware search across Spryker projects using Large Language Model (LLM)-based embeddings 
  and Chroma DB for efficient indexing and retrieval. 
  It indexes key module APIs and configurations, supports semantic understanding of code, and provides fast, 
  relevant search results to help developers navigate large or unfamiliar Spryker codebases. 
  The tool operates locally for security, offers filtering and AI-powered matching, 
  and is designed to accelerate onboarding and cross-team collaboration.
