shortPitch: >-
  With over a decade of experience in PHP and enterprise e-commerce, and eight
  years working hands-on with Spryker, I’ve helped deliver complex B2B and B2C
  solutions for major European brands. From core module extensions to full-scale
  marketplace integrations and replatforming projects, my work bridges robust
  architecture with pragmatic, maintainable code.


  Career highlights include roles as Senior Developer, Tech Lead, and Team Lead,
  where I’ve enjoyed guiding teams through legacy challenges, promoting best
  practices, and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing. Certified as a
  Spryker Foundations Developer and Marketplace Specialist, I combine deep
  platform know-how with a results-focused approach that keeps business goals
  and code quality aligned.


  Collaboration, mentoring, and solving tricky problems are what keep me
  motivated — especially in fast-paced environments where scalable systems
  really make a difference.
