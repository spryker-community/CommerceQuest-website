  With six years of hands-on experience in Spryker, I bring deep expertise in
  full-stack development, particularly in backend solutions. I have successfully
  worked on more than five diverse projects, spanning both B2B and B2C models.
  My experience covers everything from building shops from the ground up to
  optimizing and scaling existing systems. I am comfortable with both older
  versions of Spryker and the latest cloud-based versions, ensuring adaptability
  and up-to-date skills in the evolving e-commerce landscape. My proven ability
  to deliver high-quality results makes me a strong candidate for Spryker
  development roles.
