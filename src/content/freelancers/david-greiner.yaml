  After studying business informatics, I started my professional journey at
  Turbine Kreuzberg, where I gained experience with shop systems like Magento
  and OXID while working on various projects.<br/> In 2015, I decided to go
  freelance, and since 2017, I have focused exclusively on the Spryker Commerce
  OS. As a freelancer, I've had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge and
  skills across a range of Spryker projects. I’m now excited to take on new
  challenges!
