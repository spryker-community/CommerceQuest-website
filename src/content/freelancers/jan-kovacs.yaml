  <p>In 2017 I have joined Tom Tailor E-commerce GmbH as Senior Software
  Engineer for the project based on Spryker platform, and we have worked closely
  together with Spryker to replatform the TT B2C & B2B plaftorms in half a year
  - during this time some of the solutions we have chosen at TT were also
  adapted by the core Spryker product. After the support of Spryker has been
  finished, I took over the leadership of the B2C development team and we
  further developed our Spryker based B2C platform, by adopting new Spryker
  features and standards also, as well customizing as much as possible to meet
  the needs of Tom Tailor.</p><p>I worked in this role until mid of summer
  2022.</p>
