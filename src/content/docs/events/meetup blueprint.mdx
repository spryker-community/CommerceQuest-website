You want to organize Spryker User Group meetings? Cool! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to organize these local meetups and bringing the community together on a regular basis. **You are awesome!**

We already have a general [Code of Conduct](https://forum.commercequest.space/discussion/27749/community-guidelines-code-of-conduct) for our community. You can refer to this document as organizers of the User Groups.

To align ourselves, have a consistent image, and make sure your event gets the attention it deserves, we do have some tips & guidelines for you. If you have any questions/remarks about these, please let us know or submit a change!

## How to start:
- Read through this handy guide to getting started ðŸ˜‰
- Get in touch with your Spryker contact person or [fill out this contact form](https://form.asana.com/?k=Ry92V_78RAs3Zxde5AJtJw&d=21158181759478) and we'll help you take the next steps from there!

## What we expect from you as an organizer:
### General organization
- Organize regular meetups. Once every 6 months is a good pace to start with.
- Spryker community events should be open to anyone that wants to join that has a ligitemate interest in Spryker, even if that is a competitor;
- Dates should not overlap with other Spryker community meetings in the same region. You can check the [CommerceQuest events overview](https://forum.commercequest.space/events/category) and coordinate dates with surrounding community event organizers;
- If you are organizing this as a commercial company, some promotion in exchange for your effort is ok (and are of course great for employee branding in general). But these community meetings should ***not*** turn into commercial pitching, selling or recruiting events;
- You run the show: as a local organizer you are the first point of contact for speakers and attendees, not Spryker or the Spryker Community Team.

### Content/ Topics
- Spryker is not in the lead of the ideas, topics or the program of a local User Group. It is all done by you as an organizer. However, we are happy to help out where needed.
- Coordinate speakers and topics with surrounding organizers.
- Topics can of course be shared between organizers if agreed upon the creator and the speaker. If the speaker can't or won't travel to other User Group meetings, please coordinate with them if you can copy their presentation and under which conditions. Always be respectful to the original creator.

### Agenda recommendations
- We've found that allowing ~2 hours for a program with optional networking after-hours works well, but of course this is up to you. Here's a sample agenda that worked well for us:
- 18:30 - Doors open
- 19:00 - Welcome and Introductions
- 19:05 - Talk #1 w/ Q&A
- 19:35 - Break for food & drinks
- 20:00 - Talk #2 w/ Q&A
- 20:30 - Closing words & general announcements
- 20:45 onwards - Socializing and enjoying eachother's company!

### Announcing the event 
- Contact community@spryker.com to add your event details to the [CommerceQuest events overview](https://forum.commercequest.space/events/category). Your event post should include information about your event, including the date/time, agenda, topics & speakers, if there is a food & drink offer, the location, and any other relevant information.
- In your text, be as clear as possible about your target audience to manage expectations. For example: You don't want merchants showing up unknowingly to very technical developer sessions.

### During the event
- We would like to provide you with some Spryker-themed gear to set up during the event (ex. signs, a pull-up banner, or merch). Request it in time and we will deliver them to you ðŸ˜Š.
- Try to get people to already submit ideas for future meetings(locations and topics).
- Say thanks to the location hosts and sponsors (when applicable).
- Have FUN!

### After the event
- Use CommerceQuest and your social media channels to thank all the participants and ask them to contribute new topics/locations for new meetings.
- We highly recommend creating a blog (text or video) summary of the event and publish that on CommerceQuest for further promotion. These articles can of course contain links to or images from the location hosts and/or sponsors of the event.

## Help from Spryker
When following these guidelines, you can expect the following from the Spryker Community team:
- Promotion of your User Groups through our website and social channels.
- Access to our network of the best speakers from other events.
- We'll send over someone from Spryker to join the event.
- We'll send you some Spryker merch to hand out to the participants of the event.
