## Platform Contributions

Platform Contributions are ecosystem-led contributions to be built into and enhance Spryker's core product. These include bug fixes, core improvements, and documentation updates across Spryker's product portfolio.

All Platform Contributions can be submitted as pull requests towards the dedicated GitHub repositories related to the Spryker GitHub organizations below.

### How to Contribute Platform Contributions

#### Spryker Cloud Commerce OS (SCCOS) and development tools

- [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/code-contribution-guide.html)
- [Documentation](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/intro-to-spryker.html)

#### Updating Documentation (SCCOS)

Spryker Documentation accepts contributions in the form of edits and new documents. 

To edit existing documents, contributors can use the "Edit on GitHub" button in [Spryker Documentation](https://docs.spryker.com/) and create pull requests with suggestions.

To create a new document, contributors can create pull requests directly to the relevant [Spryker doc repository](https://github.com/spryker/spryker-docs).

Alternatively, the following guides are available to advise on how to create pull requests toward documentation:
- [Edit Documentation via a Web Browser](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contribute-to-the-documentation/edit-documentation-via-pull-requests.html)
- [Edit Documentation Locally](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contribute-to-the-documentation/edit-the-documentation-locally.html)

## Innovation Lab

Innovation Lab contributions are ecosystem-led submissions demonstrating innovative but often experimental use cases built for use with Spryker. 

These include hackathon projects, tools, and customer & partner innovation ideas. They may be utilized in any part of the Spryker platform, including the products listed above.

### How to Contribute to Innovation Lab

There are two distinct ways to contribute to Innovation Lab:

#### 1. Ask Spryker to create a repository within the [Spryker Community & Innovation Lab GitHub organization](https://github.com/spryker-community)

- Request access by e-mailing [community@spryker.com](mailto:community@spryker.com) or post your request in the [Community Projects CommerceQuest subforum](https://commercequest.space/categories/spryker-community-projects).
- Once you have access, begin your project and upload your first code!
- And, of course, we encourage everyone to evaluate current projects, suggest improvements, or even submit pull requests!

#### 2. Create an Innovation in your own organization

- Create an Innovation Lab repository in your own GitHub organization and communicate with the Spryker team to have this reviewed. Reviews can be requested by e-mailing [community@spryker.com](mailto:community@spryker.com), or post your request in the [Community Projects subforum](https://commercequest.space/categories/spryker-community-projects) in [CommerceQuest](https://commercequest.space/).
- If your Innovation is accepted, we will mirror it with the [Spryker Community & Innovation Lab GitHub organization](https://github.com/spryker-community) and add your contribution to our [Community Tools](https://commercequest.space/community-tools/) list to allow other Spryker developers to find it.

[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/spryker-community/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md) need to be followed in both cases listed above.

<Aside type="note">
Innovation Lab submissions are not ordinarily maintained by Spryker, with no commitment or legal obligation for this to take place.
