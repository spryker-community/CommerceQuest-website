#### Roadmap
See the [open issues](https://github.com/spryker-community/spryker-community.github.io/issues) for a full list of known issues 🪲 and features that other users have proposed already.

## Content contributions
### Updating an article
If you simply want to **update** any of [our existing docs](https://commercequest.space/guides/intro/):
- Go to [the docs](https://commercequest.space/guides/intro/) (you're already there 😊) and browse to the article you want to adjust (just like the page your are reading right now);
- On the bottom of the page, click "✏︎ Edit page". You will be redirected to the GitHub editor of this page;
- Make your edits, but leave the frontmatter (= the text on top of the page between the --- lines) intact;
- Click the green "Commit changes" button in the top right, add your commit message and click the green sign off button.

### Creating a new article
OR, if you want to create a **new** article:
- Go to [/src/content/docs](https://github.com/spryker-community/spryker-community.github.io/tree/main/src/content/docs) and select the folder (category) that fits your new article best;
- In the new folder, create a new .MDX document by clicking "Add file > Create a new file" in the top right;
- Name your file (ideally the same as the label you use in the frontmatter below);
- Create your new article, starting with this frontmatter code:
```mdx title="src/pages/post-1.mdx"
---
title: Title of your new page
description: Description of your new page 
sidebar:
    label: Short name for your page
    order: single or two digit number
---

Your article content goes here.
```
5. Click the green "Commit changes" button in the top right, add your commit message and click the green sign off button.

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.kdnuggets.com/publications/sheets/Markdown_Cheatsheet_KDnuggets.pdf)
- [Astro Markdown & MDX] (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/)

### Adding a new section / category
- Go to [/src/content/docs](https://github.com/spryker-community/spryker-community.github.io/tree/main/src/content/docs) and create a new folder (these act as categories);
- Add the first article in this new category by following the steps above.\

For more info about routing and the structure of the project, check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/).

### Adding an image to an MD(X) file

#### Upload the image
- Go to [/src/images](https://github.com/spryker-community/spryker-community.github.io/tree/main/src/images) and on the top right click "Add file" > "Upload files"
- Drag the file(s) onto your browser or click "choose your files" to upload them.
- Add a description (just the title is enough), keep other settings and click the green "Sign off and commit changes" button

#### Embed the image into your document

##### For .MD files:
Use standard Markdown `![alt](src)` syntax in your `.md` files. This syntax works with Astro’s Image Service API to optimize your local images stored in src/. Remote images and images stored in the public/ folder are not optimized.\
Example:
```md
<!-- src/pages/post-1.md -->

# My Markdown Page

<!-- Local image stored in src/assets/ -->
<!-- Use a relative file path or import alias -->
![A starry night sky.](../assets/stars.png)

<!-- Image stored in public/images/ -->
<!-- Use the file path relative to public/ -->
![A starry night sky.](/images/stars.png)

<!-- Remote image on another server -->
<!-- Use the full URL of the image -->
![Astro](https://example.com/images/remote-image.png)
```

##### For .MDX files:
If you require more control over your image attributes, we recommend using the `.mdx` file format, which allows you to include Astro's `<Image />` component or a JSX `<img />` tag in addition to the Markdown syntax.


Example:
```mdx title="src/pages/post-1.mdx"
---
title: My Page title
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import rocket from '../assets/rocket.png';

# My MDX Page

// Local image stored in the the same folder
![Houston in the wild](houston.png)

// Local image stored in src/assets/
<Image src={rocket} alt="A rocketship in space." />
<img src={rocket.src} alt="A rocketship in space." />
![A rocketship in space](../assets/rocket.png)

// Image stored in public/images/
<Image src="/images/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky." />
<img src="/images/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky." />
![A starry night sky.](/images/stars.png)

// Remote image on another server
<Image src="https://example.com/images/remote-image.png" />
<img src="https://example.com/images/remote-image.png" />
![Astro](https://example.com/images/remote-image.png)

```
### Validate if your change actually worked:
 - After your commit, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/spryker-community/spryker-community.github.io/actions) and click on the latest action that has the name of your commit.
 - While the website is rebuilding, the status will be orange. Once it's green, you can check the changes on the [live site](https://commercequest.space/).
 - If the status turns red, there was an error. You can click on the red cross to see the error message and fix it.

For more details on what you can do with images in Markdown files, check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-markdown-files).

### Setup on your local machine

<Steps>

1. Install (P)NPM or YARN with the links bewlow or install it through [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs-lts).
    - [Install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
    - [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
    - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

2. Setup the project in your favorite code editor like VSCode, Atom, or Sublime Text and clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Install the project dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and execute: `npm install`
This command will install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

4. Development Commands
    - `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot reloading enabled. View your local developement environment at `http://localhost:4321`
    - `npm run preview`: Serves your build output locally for preview before deployment.
    - `npm run build`: Bundles your site into static files for production.\
For detailed help with Astro CLI commands, visit [Astro's documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/).

5. Go forth and contribute! 🚀

</Steps>

### Deployment
Any change to the files in the Github repository will trigger a new deployment. The site is hosted on Github Pages, and the deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions.

#### Building Your Site locally

Before deployment, you can test the build:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with your built site (configurable via [outDir in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir)).

### Project Structure

ScrewFast organizes modular components, content, and layouts to streamline development and content management.

#### Static Assets and Public Resources

Static files served directly to the browser are within the `public` directory at the root of the project.

```md

public/
└── scripts/
    └── vendor/
        ├── gsap/ # Animations powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
        │   └── gsap.min.js 
        ├── lenis/ # Lenis script for smooth scrolling effects
        │   └── lenis.js
        └── preline/   # Preline UI plugins
            ├── accordion/
            ├── collapse/
            ├── dropdown/
            ├── overlay/
            └── tabs/


```

The scripts in the `public/scripts/vendor` directory are essential for the interactivity and aesthetic features of the website. Do not remove these unless you plan to replace their functionality.
